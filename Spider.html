        <h2>Spiders</h2>
        <p>Spiders are common pests that can find their way into homes through various entry points. 
        They can be both beneficial, by controlling other insect populations, and a nuisance when they invade living spaces.</p>

        <h3>How They Invade Homes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spiders often enter homes through cracks and gaps around windows, doors, and foundations.</li>
            <li>They can crawl through vents, chimneys, and gaps in utility lines to access the interior of a house.</li>
            <li>Spiders can hitch a ride on items brought into the home, such as boxes, firewood, or plants.</li>
            <li>Open doors and windows or poorly sealed areas can provide easy entry points.</li>
            <li>Spiders may also come in through unsealed or improperly maintained exterior openings, such as cracks in walls or gaps around eaves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Prevent Infestations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Seal all cracks and gaps around windows, doors, and foundations to prevent spiders from entering.</li>
            <li>Regularly clean and vacuum your home, especially corners and under furniture, to remove spider webs and egg sacs.</li>
            <li>Reduce clutter around your home to minimize potential hiding spots for spiders.</li>
            <li>Keep outdoor lights off or use yellow bug lights to reduce the number of insects that may attract spiders.</li>
            <li>Trim back shrubs, trees, and vegetation away from the house to minimize potential pathways for spiders to reach the home.</li>
            <li>Use spider repellents or insecticides in areas where spiders are commonly seen, such as corners and around windows and doors.</li>
        </ul>
