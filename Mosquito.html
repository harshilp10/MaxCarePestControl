        <h2>Mosquito</h2>
        <p>
            Mosquitoes are common pests that can become a major nuisance, especially during warmer months. 
            Known for their itchy bites and the potential to transmit diseases, mosquitoes are often found near sources of standing water, where they breed and thrive.
        </p>

        <h3>How They Invade Homes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Mosquitoes can enter homes through open doors and windows, particularly if screens are damaged or missing.</li>
            <li>They are often attracted to indoor lights and can slip through small gaps or cracks in walls and foundations.</li>
            <li>Mosquitoes may breed near homes with standing water, such as birdbaths, clogged gutters, or poorly drained areas, increasing their presence indoors.</li>
            <li>They are drawn to carbon dioxide and body heat, which leads them to follow people indoors when doors are left open.</li>
            <li>Unsealed vents, utility openings, or poorly fitted window screens can also serve as entry points for mosquitoes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Prevent Infestations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure all doors and windows have intact screens, and repair any holes or gaps immediately.</li>
            <li>Eliminate standing water around your home by regularly cleaning gutters, emptying birdbaths, and fixing any drainage issues.</li>
            <li>Use mosquito repellents, particularly citronella or DEET-based sprays, to reduce mosquito bites both indoors and outdoors.</li>
            <li>Install mosquito netting over beds and outdoor seating areas to create a barrier against these pests.</li>
            <li>Keep doors closed as much as possible to minimize opportunities for mosquitoes to enter the home.</li>
            <li>Use fans indoors and outdoors to disrupt mosquitoes, as they struggle to fly in strong air currents.</li>
            <li>Consider installing outdoor insect-repelling lights to reduce mosquito activity near entry points.</li>
        </ul>
