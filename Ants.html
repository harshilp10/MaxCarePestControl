        <h2>Ants</h2>
        <p>ants are social insects that can invade homes in search of food, water, and shelter. They find thier way into homes through various mean, such as cracks/gaps, utility lines, openings around doors and windows, basement/crawl space, plants/trees, and food sources. </p>

        <h3>How They Invade Homes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Small cracks in walls, foundations, and around windows and doors provide easy entry points.</li>
            <li>Ants can use utility lines, such as electrical and plumbing lines, to gain access to homes.</li>
            <li>Poorly sealed doors and windows can allow ants to enter.</li>
            <li>Damp and dark areas like basements and crawl spaces are attractive to ants.</li>
            <li>Ants can use branches and plants that touch the exterior of a home as bridges to get inside.</li>
            <li>They are often attracted by accessible food sources, such as crumbs, spills, and pet food.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Prevent Infestations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Close off any cracks, gaps, and crevices in walls, foundations, and around doors and windows.</li>
            <li>Keep kitchen and dining areas clean, store food in airtight containers, and clean up spills and crumbs immediately.</li>
            <li>Use sealed trash cans and dispose of garbage regularly.</li>
            <li>Keep trees, shrubs, and plants trimmed and away from the house to reduce access points.</li>
            <li>Repair any plumbing leaks and ensure proper drainage to reduce moisture that attracts ants.</li>
            <li>Place ant baits and traps in areas where ants are commonly seen to control their population.</li>
        </ul>
