        <h2>Silver Fish</h2>
        <p>
            Silverfish are small, wingless insects known for their silvery-gray appearance and quick, fish-like movements.
            They thrive in dark, damp environments and are often found in homes, particularly in basements, bathrooms, and kitchens.
            While they do not pose health risks, they can cause damage to household items.
        </p>

        <h3>How They Invade Homes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Silverfish enter homes through cracks, crevices, and gaps in foundations, walls, and around doors and windows.</li>
            <li>They are drawn to moist, humid environments like bathrooms, basements, and kitchens, where they can find food and water.</li>
            <li>Silverfish often hide in cardboard boxes, old papers, books, and stored fabrics, making storage areas prime invasion spots.</li>
            <li>They can also be introduced to homes through infested items like secondhand books, furniture, or packaging materials.</li>
            <li>Silverfish can climb walls and squeeze into tiny spaces, making it easy for them to spread throughout a home once they get in.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Prevent Infestations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce humidity levels by using dehumidifiers and fixing leaky pipes or faucets in damp areas like basements and bathrooms.</li>
            <li>Seal any cracks, gaps, or crevices around the foundation, doors, windows, and walls to prevent entry.</li>
            <li>Store paper products, books, and clothing in airtight containers to protect them from silverfish damage.</li>
            <li>Regularly clean and declutter areas where silverfish are likely to hide, such as closets, basements, and attics.</li>
            <li>acuum frequently to remove any potential food sources, such as crumbs, dust, or dead skin cells, which silverfish feed on.</li>
            <li>Use natural repellents like cedar or lavender in storage areas to deter silverfish from nesting in your home.</li>
        </ul>
