        <h2>Rats and Mice</h2>
        <p>Rats and Mice are highly skilled at finding their ways into homes through various means, such as cracks and holes, pipes, vents and chimneys, roof, basement and garages. </p>

        <h3>How They Invade Homes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They can squeeze through small cracks, holes, and gaps in walls, foundations, and around windows and doors.</li>
            <li>They often enter through openings around utility pipes and wiring.</li>
            <li>These rodents can use vents, chimneys, and other openings to access the interior of a house.</li>
            <li>They can climb trees, walls, and utility lines to access roofs and enter through gaps in eaves or roof tiles.</li>
            <li>Open doors, windows, or poorly sealed areas in basements and garages provide easy entry points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Prevent Infestations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Close off any cracks, gaps, and holes around the foundation, windows, doors, and utility pipes.</li>
            <li>Keep living areas clean and free of food debris. Store food in airtight containers and clean up spills immediately.</li>
            <li>Use sealed trash cans and dispose of garbage regularly.</li>
            <li>Remove clutter, both inside and outside the home, to reduce potential nesting sites.</li>
            <li>Keep trees, shrubs, and vegetation trimmed and away from the house to reduce roof access.</li>
            <li>Set up traps and baits in areas where rodents are likely to travel, such as along walls and near entry points.</li>
        </ul>
