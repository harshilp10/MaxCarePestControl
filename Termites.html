        <h2>Termites</h2>
        <p>Termites are destructive insects that feed on wood and other cellulose-based materials. 
        They can cause severe structural damage to homes if left unchecked. 
        Termites are often difficult to detect until they have already established large colonies, making early identification and prevention critical.</p>

        <h3>How They Invade Homes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Termites enter homes through cracks in the foundation, gaps in walls, or through underground tunnels built by subterranean species.</li>
            <li>They are attracted to moisture, and often gain entry through areas where wood is in contact with damp soil, such as basements or crawl spaces.</li>
            <li>Termites can infest wooden structures like support beams, floors, and walls, often entering undetected through tiny cracks.</li>
            <li>They can also enter homes by swarming, where winged reproductive termites fly into homes and establish new colonies.</li>
            <li>Wood piles, mulch, and other cellulose materials stored near the home can attract termites and provide them easy access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Prevent Infestations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Seal any cracks or gaps in the foundation and walls to prevent termites from entering your home.</li>
            <li>Ensure proper drainage around the home to avoid water accumulation, which can attract termites to damp wood.</li>
            <li>Keep wood, mulch, and debris away from the foundation and avoid direct contact between wood structures and soil.</li>
            <li>Regularly inspect wooden structures for signs of termite damage, such as hollow-sounding wood or small holes.</li>
            <li>Use termite-resistant materials for home construction and treat exposed wood with protective coatings.</li>
            <li>Install termite bait systems or barriers around the home to detect and control termite colonies before they cause damage.</li>
        </ul>
