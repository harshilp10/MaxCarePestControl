        <h2>Squirrels</h2>
        <p>Squirrels are active, agile creatures often found in trees and wooded areas, but they can become a problem when they invade homes and properties. 
        They are known to chew through wires, insulation, and wood, causing significant damage and potential fire hazards.</p>

        <h3>How They Invade Homes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Squirrels can enter homes through small gaps, cracks, or openings in roofs, soffits, and eaves.</li>
            <li>They may chew through vents, attic screens, and even wooden structures to gain access.</li>
            <li>Squirrels can use overhanging tree branches to reach rooftops and explore potential entry points.</li>
            <li>They often nest in attics, chimneys, and wall voids, where they create nests out of insulation and other materials.</li>
            <li>Open garage doors, windows, or crawl spaces can also be entry points for squirrels.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Prevent Infestations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Trim tree branches that are close to your roof to prevent easy access to the house.</li>
            <li>Seal gaps, holes, and cracks in your roof, eaves, and foundation to block entry points.</li>
            <li>Use chimney caps and attic screens to keep squirrels from entering through vents or chimneys.</li>
            <li>Regularly inspect and maintain attic and roof areas to identify and repair any damage caused by squirrels</li>
            <li>Remove food sources like birdseed or fallen fruits from your yard, which may attract squirrels.</li>
            <li>Install squirrel-proof barriers or traps in areas where they are likely to enter or cause damage.</li>
        </ul>
