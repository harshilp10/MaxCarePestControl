        <h2>Racoons</h2>
        <p>
            Raccoons are nocturnal animals that are known for their intelligence and adaptability.
            They often invade homes and properties in search of food, water, and shelter.
            While they may seem harmless, raccoons can cause significant damage to structures and pose health risks due to the diseases they carry.
        </p>

        <h3>How They Invade Homes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Raccoons can tear open soffits, shingles, and vents to access attics, garages, and other parts of the home.</li>
            <li>They often enter homes through chimneys, uncapped vents, and attic openings.</li>
            <li>These animals are skilled climbers and can use trees, downspouts, and fences to reach roofs.</li>
            <li>Raccoons may dig under decks, sheds, or porches to create dens, especially in colder weather.</li>
            <li>They are attracted to garbage, pet food, and bird feeders, which can encourage them to stay near your property.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Prevent Infestations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Secure garbage cans with tight-fitting lids or store them in a locked shed or garage.</li>
            <li>Eliminate moisture by fixing leaks and using dehumidifiers.</li>
            <li>Properly manage waste by using sealed trash cans.</li>
            <li>Trim tree branches away from the house to reduce roof access.</li>
            <li>Remove outdoor food sources, such as bird feeders, pet food, or open compost piles.</li>
            <li>Use motion-activated lights or sprinklers to deter raccoons from approaching your home at night.</li>
            <li>Close off crawl spaces, under decks, and other areas where raccoons might create dens.</li>
        </ul>
