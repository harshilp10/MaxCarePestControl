        <h2>Wasps</h2>
        <p>Wasps are aggressive insects that can become a serious problem when they build nests near homes. 
        They often seek out sheltered areas for nesting and can be a danger to humans, especially for those allergic to their stings.</p>

        <h3>How They Invade Homes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Wasps often build nests in sheltered areas such as eaves, attics, wall cavities, or under porches.</li>
            <li>They can enter homes through open windows, doors, or vents that are not properly screened.</li>
            <li>Wasps may use cracks and gaps around foundations, walls, and roofs to enter interior spaces like attics or basements.</li>
            <li>They are attracted to sugary foods and drinks, making outdoor dining areas and kitchens a target for wasps seeking food.</li>
            <li>Nests may also be built inside hollow spaces, such as tree trunks, sheds, garages, or even outdoor furniture.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Prevent Infestations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Regularly inspect your home and outdoor areas for the early signs of wasp nests, especially in eaves, sheds, and attics.</li>
            <li>Seal any cracks, gaps, or holes around windows, doors, and roofs to prevent wasps from entering or building nests inside.</li>
            <li>Keep food and sugary drinks covered when outdoors, and promptly clean up spills and food scraps to avoid attracting wasps.</li>
            <li>Use screens on windows, doors, and vents to block wasps from entering the home.</li>
            <li>Trim trees, shrubs, and vegetation near the house to eliminate potential nesting sites.</li>
            <li>If you find a wasp nest, avoid disturbing it and contact a pest control professional for safe removal.</li>
        </ul>
